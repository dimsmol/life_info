- NOTE: with freeze dried food and canister stove you don't really need knife a lot, so simplest thing that works and can help in emergency should be enough, still the list below also includes more expensive options you may like
- NOTE: look for:
  - fixed blade (more convenient)
  - drop point (best for outdoor needs)
  - stainless steel
    - WARN: avoid carbon steel - it needs care and gets rusty easily
  - non-serrated
    - most serrated knives are serrated in a short area near the handle, which makes them worse for precision job and doesn't help much with anything else
  - sturdy
  - good sheath
