# low fodmap food

- use Monash [App](https://www.monashfodmap.com/ibs-central/i-have-ibs/get-the-app/) for low FODMAP food list and safe amounts
  - pay attention to amounts!
  - there is a lot of other info sources, but they often can be wrong or miss info on safe amounts, which makes them pretty useless
- below are some useful safe-ish options and where to find them

legend:

- _(small)_ - safe in very small amounts
- no mark - safe in bigger amounts, still should be limited
- _(unlim)_ - _should_ be safe in any amount

avoid:

- [Fody](https://fodyfoods.com) bars, etc. - quality is mediocre

## supplements

- [Saltstick Electrolyte Salt Capsules](https://www.rei.com/product/823163/saltstick-electrolyte-salt-capsules-100-capsules) - this specific kind looks to be safe
