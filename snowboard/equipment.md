## notes

* buy board first
	* twin is good for starter
	* banana is matter of taste
	* size must be between chin and nose ([more precisely](http://snowfaq.nm.ru/#q1p13))
* cover must be a little bit greater than board
	* ideally must easily fit boots and helmet - it's very convenient
* bindings must match board
	* ask to set bindings in store
	* be sure are you regular or goofy (or maybe prefer dusk stance)
	* angles 15/0 or 15/5 are ok for starter
* boots must match bindings
	* it's better if they have the same manufacturer (for best fit)
* helmet + goggles must be bought together to match one to other
	* helmet must fit well
* goggles must be good and fit well
	* try many goggles, many helmets in different combinations
	* color must match goals (darker for mountaines, lighter for suburb)
		* can use filters ?
	* should fit really well (no holes around or between goggles and helmet)
* gloves must be good
