# Knives

With freeze dried food and canister stove you don't really need knife a lot, so simplest thing that works and can help in emergency should be enough.

Look for:

- fixed blade (more convenient)
- drop point (best for outdoor needs)
- stainless steel
  - WARN: avoid carbon steel - it needs care and gets rusty easily
- non-serrated
  - most serrated knives are serrated in a short area near the handle, this makes them worse for precision job and doesn't help much with anything else
- sturdy
- good sheath
