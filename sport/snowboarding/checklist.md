## notes

- buy board first
  - twin is good for beginning
  - banana is a matter of taste
  - size must be between chin and nose (for more see [article](http://snowfaq.nm.ru/#q1p13))
- cover must be a little bit bigger than board
  - ideally must easily fit boots and helmet - it's very convenient
- bindings must match board
  - ask to set bindings in store
  - be sure are you regular or goofy (or maybe prefer duck stance)
  - angles 15/0 or 15/5 are ok for beginning
- boots must match bindings and must be good
  - it's better if they have the same manufacturer (for best fit)
- prefer socks with medium+ cushion
  - adding liner socks can be a good idea
- helmet + goggles must be bought together to match one to other
  - helmet must fit well
- goggles must be good and fit well
  - try many goggles, many helmets in different combinations
  - lens color must match goals (darker for mountains, lighter for suburb)
  - can use filters ?
  - should fit really well (no holes around or between goggles and helmet)
- gloves must be good
  - inner gloves proved to be very convenient
